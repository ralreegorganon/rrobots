##
# This is the module you must include in your AI class in order to
# have a working robot. It provides all of the state, event, and
# actions that a bot may perform in the game.
#
# These methods are intentionally of very basic nature, you are free
# to unleash the whole power of ruby to create higher level functions.
# (e.g. move_to, fire_at and so on)
#
# Some words of explanation: The gun is mounted on the body, if you
# turn the body the gun will follow. In a similar way the radar is
# mounted on the gun. The radar scans everything it sweeps over in a
# single tick (100 degrees if you turn your body, gun and radar in the
# same direction) but will report only the distance of scanned robots,
# not the angle. If you want more precision you have to turn your
# radar slower.
#
# You must implement Robot#tick for your AI to respond to the game.
